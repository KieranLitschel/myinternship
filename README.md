# myinternship

An application created at HackCambridge Ternary (Jan 2018) by myself and [KieranLitschel](https://github.com/KieranLitschel). The application tries to tackle the issue of mananging lots of internship applications without the use of an agency. After having applied to many different places we found we were getting overwhelmed by the number of responses and were finding it hard to keep up with the status of all the applications.
This application uses the [Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api) to search emails for key phrases to do with applications for example; "rejected","unfortunatly","unsuccessful" would indicate that the application was not successful.

## Progress
### January 2018

HackCambridge Ternary was our first time partaking in a weekend long hackathon event. We decided to jump in the deep end and try something we'd never done before: developing web apps. In hindsight, we focused too much trying to create a fully working system by implementing google authentication right off the bat. After speaking to more experienced hackers it became clear that this is the wrong approach! I believe we could have had much more success by focusing on a prototype version of the application to ensure that the mechanics work properly. We hope to keep working on this project in our spare time however as we believe it could be very useful for many students.
